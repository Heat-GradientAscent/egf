# EGF/Efficient Geode Farms - v0.1.0 
This app is a program that can generate a farm that mines amethyst efficiently as shown in [ilmango's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY90xF3ug84). It is made entirely in Python and does not depend on the internal workings of Mojang's Minecraft or Masa's Litematica mod for Minecraft. It makes use of the `nbtlib` and `litemapy` libraries for manipulating nbt files (.schematic files).
